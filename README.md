# Weather Program

## Overview

The Weather Program is a command-line application that provides current weather information for U.S. cities. Users can retrieve weather data by entering either the city and state, or the ZIP code. The program fetches data from the OpenWeatherMap API and displays details such as temperature, humidity, pressure, and weather descriptions.
